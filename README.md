# SVD-on-MNIST-DATASET
1.For the MNIST dataset, applied feature reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD).  

2. Classified the dataset using logistic regression before applying the feature reduction. 

3. Classified the dataset using logistic regression after applying the feature reduction using SVD.

4. Found the optimal feature dimension based on the accuracy.

5. For the optimal feature dimension, evaluated the model before and after applying the feature dimension based on Precision, Recall and F1-Score for each class.
