# SVD-on-MNIST-DATASET
1. For the MNIST dataset, apply the feature reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD). (8 marks) 2. Classify the dataset using logistic regression before applying the feature reduction. (3 marks) 3. Classify the dataset using logistic regression after applying the feature reduction using SVD. (4 marks) 4. Find the optimal feature dimension based on the accuracy. (7 marks) 5. For the optimal feature dimension, evaluate the model before and after applying the feature dimension based on Precision, Recall and F1-Score for each class. (8 marks)
